# ReactProjectsList

This repo is exactly what you might imagine - a simple readme project for listing react based projects to be found throughout various repositories within this account.

## Trivial projects

- [Github Account finder V2](https://github.com/irisida/hubfinderv2) - refactored to use the contaxt API as well as Hooks. No additonal functionality offered.
- [Github account finder V1](https://github.com/irisida/hubfinderv1) - crude codebase that uses prop drilling and various begginer/outdated approaches.
