# React Projects List

This repo is exactly what you might imagine it to be - a simple readme based project for listing react based projects to be found throughout various repositories within this account. The purpose is to make it easier to find a traverse projects in the repositories that are using react. The earliest are probably V16.8 based.

## Smaller projects and demos

- [Card-io - Task Logger App](https://github.com/irisida/card-io) - React FE/UI for logging tasks, creating resources ot handle tasks and uses json-server as a fake API. Primary purpose is utilisation of redux.

- [Contacts keeping app](https://github.com/irisida/contact-keeper) - small demo project with node/express BE, mongoose abstraction to a MongoDB cluster and a react17 FE/UI app. Demos the use of hooks/context combo.

## Quick & dirty / trivial projects

- [Github Account finder V2](https://github.com/irisida/hubfinderv2) - refactored to use the contaxt API as well as Hooks. No additonal functionality offered.
- [Github account finder V1](https://github.com/irisida/hubfinderv1) - crude codebase that uses prop drilling and various begginer/outdated approaches.
